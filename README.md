# KeyGate Server:
The server component of the KeyGate project.

## 🗝️ What is KeyGate?
KeyGate aims to be a self-hosted end-to-end encrypted file vault. Built to run on Linux using limited hardware such as a Raspberry Pi.

## 🔒 Security Notice
⚠️ Use with caution — this build has not been independently security audited. ⚠️ 

KeyGate uses HTTPS (TLS) for data in transit and encrypts data at rest using standard cryptographic primitives provided provided by Go’s crypto libraries. However, the system’s cryptographic
design and implementation have not undergone independent or professional security auditing.
